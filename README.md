# About

JPG scans of the 1989 BMW Repair Manual for E30 M3 (S14B23) and 320is (S14B20), indexed here via HTML.

This manual is available online in various formats (VM, PDF, etc.) but I wanted a simple HTML based 'file explorer' which I could pull-up on my mobile phone browser. Because typically when I need to check the repair manual, I'm underneath the car, covered in oily-sh*te and not in the mood to de-glove, trapse into the house, and scroll through a PDF on my laptop.

# Online Version

My domain and this repo is hosted via Github pages, here:

# Notes

Almost all of the JPG images were blatantly scraped from [https://m3guru.bmwe30m3.net/](https://m3guru.bmwe30m3.net/) – which at the time of making this project seemed to be a defunct website... however m3guru created a new post shortly before Xmas 2023! So I do plan to reach out to him at some point. 
          FWIW, I edited the scraped files: Deleted duplicates, re-named them based on text content, added missing or poorly scanned pages (WIP), so the E30 community now has a clean image dump of the entire repair manual here on GitHub.

# Site Contents

`./index.html` = list of all BMW's index pages, click links to open JPGs or click titles to view `/SECTION/index.html`

`./index-all.hmtl` = list of everything on one page, click to open JPGs

`./index-pages.html` = work-in-progress, testing thumbnail interaction

`./SECTION/index.html` = list of all pages on a per-section basis, click links to open JPGs

# Goals

* Make the BMW E30 M3/320is Repair Manual easily and quickly accessible from any web/mobile browser.
* Nothing fancy, keep the 'file explorer' design first and foremost.
* If anyone else wants to download the repo and go nuts, be my guest :)
* Eventually OCR / convert the JPG index pages to text / HTML. I'm not in a rush to do this.
