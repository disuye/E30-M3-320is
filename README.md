# What

JPG scans of the 1989 BMW Repair Manual for E30 M3 (S14B23) and 320is (S14B20), and also the 1990 BMW M3 Electrical Troubleshooting Manual, indexed via simple HTML.

# Why

The repair manual is available online in various formats (VM, PDF, etc.) but I wanted a simple HTML based 'file explorer' which could be opened with any mobile phone browser.

Hosting all of these documents on Github gives the E30 M3/320is community an easily searchable archive of all scanned manual pages, to refer to / link back to – and these links should hopefully remain unchanged for as long as Github exists.

# Where

The domain below is operated by me, however, it's a good idea to bookmark this Github repo in case the domain changes.

# Site Structure

`./index.html` 

⇧ list of chapter index pages; links open individual chapter index pages i.e: `/SECTION/index.html`

`./SECTION/index.html` 

⇧ list of scanned JPGs relevant to individual chapter ('Engine', 'Brakes' etc. etc.); links open scanned JPGs

`./index-all.hmtl` 

⇧ list of all scanned JPGs together on one page, use CTRL+F or similar to perform a text search

`./index-pages.html`

⇧ do not look at this, worse-than-beta; CSS-only rapid thumbnail viewer

# JPG Source

Many of the JPG images were WGET scraped from [https://m3guru.bmwe30m3.net/](https://m3guru.bmwe30m3.net/) which – at the time of making this repository – seemed to be a defunct website. However, m3guru created a new blog post shortly before Xmas 2023, so I've since reached out to apologise. 

I deleted duplicate scans, re-named all files based on content, organised all scans sequentially as per the original manual structure, added missing pages from other PDFs, added missing sections, and included better quality scanned pages from other sources where necessary. 

And regarding the 1990 BMW M3 Electrical Troubleshooting Manual, that was ripped from PDF to JPG using Affinity Designer, with some image adjustments during the batch process.

# Goals

* Make the BMW E30 M3/320is Repair Manual accessible on any mobile browser.
* Simple 'file explorer' style design. Nothing fancy.
* Simple CSS and HTML. No other web tech.
* Make scanned JPGs searchable via text search.

# Notes on Copyright

These images ultimately belong to BMW. If BMW takes issue then I will delete the entire repo immediately on request. BMW does make all of this data freely available from www.BMW-GroupArchiv.de ... there is no fee/cost to download the original PDFs. 

My only intention is to make a 1300++ pages of PDF manuals easier to manage on a mobile device. 

Regarding this repo – go nuts – do what you want. Fork it, steal for you own website. As long as you don't make any income from it, go ahead and use it
