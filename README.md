1989 BMW Repair Manual for E30 M3 (S14B23) and 320is (S14B20), indexed via HTML. 

This manual is available online in various formats (VM, PDF, etc.) but I wanted a simple HTML based 'file explorer' which I could pull-up on my mobile phone browser (typically while underneath the car, covered in oily-sh*te and not in the mood to de-glove, trapse into the house, and scroll through a PDF on my laptop).

NOTE: Almost all of the JPG images were blatantly scraped from [https://m3guru.bmwe30m3.net/](https://m3guru.bmwe30m3.net/) – which at the time of making this project seemed to be a defunct website... however m3guru created a new post shortly before Xmas 2023! So I do plan to reach out to him at some point. 
          FWIW, I edited the scraped files: Deleted duplicates, re-named them based on text content, added missing or poorly scanned pages (WIP), so the E30 community now has a clean image dump of the entire repair manual.
